# How does this work?
This app lets you install various popular Linux distributions on your Android device by using chroot (for rooted phones) and PRoot (for non rooted phones) functionality on the Android system. The application also provides you a graphics layer or Desktop environment (Xfce, MATE, LXDE, LXQt) on the top of the Linux shell which makes the user experience much better than working on a Linux command line.

# What can you do with Mobilinux?
Pretty much anything you like to do. You're just limited by the lack of the full Linux kernel, the SELinux policies of your Android versions, your CPU architecture and your device's hardware. We have users replacing their entire laptops and computer with Android phone and Mobilinux. We are looking for something that can support web-browsing, coding or anything else that is not really taxing on your phone's hardware then you can use Mobilinux without any issues.

You don't have to worry about multi-booting your system which means you can have all the Linux flavours installed at once. **12 OS at once given that you have the storage for it.** Install as many as you like, uninstall them when you're done.

# Are we open-source? 


Yes but no. Mobilinux is partially open-source. All the free distro tar files and the shell scripts are available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MobilinuxApp/Mobiconsole-CLI/). While the actual Android app and all the files concerning Mobilinux are close-source for obvious reasons.

That doesn't mean that we don't love open-source, **we** like **open-source**.
